# Image-Restoration-usin-Inpainting
This is a Image Restoration Program using Fast marching method and naiver-stokes. This is a simple image restoration program where user have to specify the anomaly of color that has tainted the image in given code itself as the trained model to detect the color is currently we are working on. The user also have to give image location in the code only.

How To Run
1) Download the respective models: 
                                   
                                   pip install opencv-python;    

                                   pip install matplotlib;
                                   
                                   pip install numpy;
                                   
2) Check Image for the anomaly color.
3) Change the color in program with respect to anomaly.
4) Give image location in code itself.
5) Run the code and compare the outputs of both method.
6) Save the image if anomaly is reduce or redo same steps iteratively until anomaly is almost gone.
